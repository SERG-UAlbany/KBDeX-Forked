1,A1 ,So we need lambda and its give us the *** so with the wavelength we can find velocity. And with...,DefaultGroup,1350268353000 ,
2,A3,And we don't have to works [sic] with the-work-function right away.,DefaultGroup,1350268481000 ,
3,A1 ,Not right away but we do need the-work-function at the end.,DefaultGroup,1350268501000 ,
4,A3,Ok to find the...,DefaultGroup,1350268525000 ,
5,A1 ,Because the important thing that for the lambda we are find the wavelength of the electron not of light,DefaultGroup,1350268573000 ,
6,A3,"Right, exactly. So, first for the electron we use Planck/mass velocity because we know the mass of an electron",DefaultGroup,1350268581000 ,
7,A1 ,We need to find the mass of an electron.,DefaultGroup,1350268640000 ,
8,A3,"No, we know the mass of an electron. It's an electron.",DefaultGroup,1350268642000 ,
9,A1 ,"Very true, very true",DefaultGroup,1350268652000 ,
10,A3,But we don't know...,DefaultGroup,1350268681000 ,
11,A1 ,With this wavelength we would be find velocity,DefaultGroup,1350268688000 ,
12,A2,"What did they give us. For the following wavelength. So, well lambda equal [sic] Planck/mass velocity right?",DefaultGroup,1350268693000 ,
13,A1 ,"Yes, its tell us to use lambda equal Planck/mass velocity.",DefaultGroup,1350268737000 ,
14,A1 ,You can find energy-k.,DefaultGroup,1350268742000 ,
15,A3,Energy-k of a photon.,DefaultGroup,1350268753000 ,
16,A1 ,Use energy-k of the-work-function equal [sic] energy-k equal Planck nu minus the-work-function equal energy-k of a photon and use energy-k of a photon to find the wavelength of light.,DefaultGroup,1350268759000 ,
