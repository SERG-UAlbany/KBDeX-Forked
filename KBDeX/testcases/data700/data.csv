1,H.N.,"My Theory I think that Eunice is right because temperature will affect the rate of reaction, the higher the temperature the faster the reaction. Since the chemical cell use the principal of displacement reaction, so the rate will also be affected by temperature."
2,C.M.,A wet cell is a cell with the electrolyte in liqiud state. A dry cell is a cell with the electrolyte in pasty low-moisture form. wet cell is a precursor to dry cell and is commnly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry.
3,C.M.,"He is Alessandro Volta. He repeated Galvani's experiments many times with many different materials. And make a conclusion that it was the two dissimilar metals that produced the electicity. In 1800, after extensive experimentation, he developed the voltaic pile.It consisted of a pile of zinc and silver discs and between alternating discs, a piece of cardboard that had been soaked in saltwater. In this way, he discovered the electrochemical series, and the law that the electromotive force of a galcanic cell. The battery made by Volta is credited as the first electrochemical cell. The positive electrode = Zinc The negative electrode = Copper The electrolyte = Sulphuric acid Disadvantage = unsafe to handle = the power of the cell diminishes over time due to the accumulating of hydrogen gas "
4,C.M.,Galvanic cell is made up of two different metals and a salt bridge.  The positive electrode = Zinc The negative electrode = Copper The electrolyte = CuSO4 The electron flows from Zinc to Copper through the external circult. At positive electrode : Zn(s) --> Zn2+(aq) + 2e- At negative electrode : Cu2+(aq) + 2e- --> Cu(s) The usage of the salt bridge: -to balance the charges of the two solution -to complete the circult 
5,J.K.,"daniell cell positive electrode: copper container negative electrode: zinc strip electrolyte: copper (II) sulphate solution and zinc sulphate solution At the negative electrode: Zinc ionizes to form zinc ions and electron. Then the mobile electron flow to the positive electrode in the external circuit. As a result, the mass of the zinc strip decreases. At the positive electrode: The copper(II) ions in the copper(II) sulphate solution react with the electron from the negative electrode to form copper metal. Therefore, copper deposits on the copper container The porous pot acts as a salt bridge. It completes the circuit by allowing ions to move between the two solutions through its small holes. In this cell, sulphate ions move from the positive electrode to the negative electrode via the porous pot, while the zinc ions move in opposite direction to maintain neutrality. The chemical equation for the overall reaction: Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) Å® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)"
6,R.Y.,"I need to understand i want to ask is size really don't matter the voltage? As we have all know that quantity matters insead of size, everybody ries to cut he potato/orange/apple/lemon as small as possible, in other words: as much as possible. But is size really soes not affect?"
7,R.N.,"My Theory I think the reaction between the two is a redox reaction, because when the reaction was enclosed in the small vacant space of dry ice( which means there's no oxygen provided from the atmosphere), the reaction still occurred and the end products were black carbon and white magnesium oxide. In the reaction, the reducing agent is magnesium because it causes the reduction of carbon dioxide; while carbon dioxide is the oxidizing agent as it causes the oxidation of magnesium and the magnesium metal became magnesium oxide. "
8,R.N.,"My Theory I think it is a redox reaction because firstly the copper metal react with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide and then it turned black. After that, when hydrogen gas funnel was put on top of the copper(II) oxide, the black metal oxide turned to its original bronze colour again. When hydrogen gas was added to copper(II) oxide, it acted as reducing agent to cause reduction of the metal oxide and the metal oxide became copper metal again. I would like to ask, why wasn't water formed in the end, as hydrogen reacted with oxygen from the copper(II) oxide."

51,p.J.,answering the follow up question : The electrolyte is aqueous state in wet cell while solid state in dry cell.
52,T.L.,My Theory I think that MgCl2 can also conduct electricity as there are mobile ions in the solution.
53,V.Y.,Opinion i think it will still conduct elecricity as MgCl2 is an aqueous solution. Cu may not affect the solution on conducting electricity as it does not react with either HCl or MgCl2.
54,A.L.,"My Theory i guess it still conduct electricity as it is still an aqueous solution. But i think when the HCl turns to MgCl2, the cell starts to die down. I need to understand I want to know where the hydrogen ions go? do they release as hydrogen gas? "
55,V.Y.,Opinion i think the hydrogen ions are released a hydrogen gas
56,R.Y.,"My Theory Since the solution is still an aqueous solution, it can possibly conducts electrivity. Since Cu would not have displacement reaction with MgCl2. I guess Cu would have no effect on the solution of MgCl2. But you have to remember that the Mg pole has possibly died down already."
57,A.L.,"I need to understand As we have done the experiment today, i heard mr lam said it doesn't matter which fruit were used.It doesn't affect the voltage, Why ?"
58,R.N.,My Theory I guess this is because all those fruits contain electrolyte for the electron flow!? But I am not sure about it
59,V.Y.,Opinion i think it's because fruit contain either acid or salt solution in it and they provide for the electron to pass through. 
60,p.J.,"According to your answer, Mg will react with HCl and then dissolve in it. If the Mg dissolved in HCl, then the Mg pole would be disappeared. So how does the circut work if it is only with one Cu electric pole?"
61,K.K.,My Theory I think the electric circuit won't work any more as there are no electron flowing from negative electrode to positive electrode. 
62,K.K.,My Theory MgCl2 can still conduct electricity as there are magnesium ions and chloride ions. It has a giant ionic structure.
63,R.K.,"I need to understand I know lower the pH, better the conductivity and a higher voltage will be obtained, but why lower the pH vlue, better the conductivity? How could higher the hydrogen ion concentration affect the conductivity?"
64,E.M.,"I think that is because the voltage depends on which electrode we use. The larger the seperation of the two metals in the reactivity series, the higher voltage can be obtained. The fruit is just providing the ionic solution and to close the circut for the chemical cell."

68,G.L.,"The porous pot acts as a salt bridge. It completes the circuit by allowing ions to move between the two solutions through its small holes. In the Daniell cell, sulphate ions move from the positive electrode to the negative electrode via the porous pot, while the zinc ions move in opposite direction to maintain neutrality."
69,D.L.,"New information The Daniell cell proper consists of a central zinc anode dipping into a porous pot containing zinc solution.

The use of a porous barrier prevents the copper ions in the copper solution from reaching the zinc anode and undergoing reduction."
70,R.N.,"My Theory When the magnesium and the copper strips are dipped into the hydrochloric acid, the light bulb lighted up. The principle behind is the negative electrode (magnesium strip) donated electron to the positive electrode (copper strip) and formed hydogen gas. The above reaction produce a flow of electron and close the external circuit, therefore there's a flow of electron and the light bulb lighted up. But I would like to ask, why did the light bulb lighted up for a second or two and smoke or some fume came out from the solution as shown in the video? "

74,p.J.,"I need to understand As some of you said that the fruit is just act like a media for elctrons to pass through other places, then why strong acid will conduct elctricity better than weak acid? And why the types of fruit won't affect the voltage?"
75,C.M.,"I need to understand Why Mg-Cu cell need to use acid as electrolyte? The friut cell, galvanic cell, daniel cell and almost all other cell we have learnt do not use acid as electrolyte. Why can't we use Cu(NO3)2 or other solution for Mg-Cu cell? The acid may react with the metal and form sth stable. There may have less electron. for example HCl Mg + 2HCl --> MgCl2 + H2O"

78,R.Y.,"My Theory die of cell means cell is flat, 0.8V is considered as flat of cell. "
79,E.M.,"My Theory As strong acid ionizes completely to form hydrogen ions, it has a higher concentration of hydrogen ions. It has a higher concentration of mobile ions, therefore it conducts electricity better than weak, which ionizes partially only, and has a lower concentration of mobile ions. I think it can be related to the experiment we did in the first term, concerning the electrical conductivity of strong and weak acids by observing the brightness of the light bulbs, and the chapter of weak and strong scid. And for the second question, the fruit is only providing a platform for conducting electricity. The voltage depends on which metals you use, the temperature, the size of the pieces of metals etc. The larger the seperation of the metals in the elctrochemical series, the larger the voltage will be."
80,K.K.,"I need to understand  When we checked the voltage of the chemical cell (Mg-Cu) on Monday, it falls constantly. Why? i.l. I think that the electron of magnesium is released to copper constantly. There are less and less electron flowing from magnesium to copper in the circuit. Therefore the voltage falls. Are there any other suggestions? "
81,E.M.,I need to understand I want to know why temperature or atmospheric pressure will affect the voltage reading in our fruit cell experiment? Are they related to the rate of reaction? I remember that Mr Lam mentioned that these factors will affect the results.
82,E.M.,"My Theory I think this is not possible, using copper(II) nitrate as the electrolyte. As magnesium is more reactive than copper, the magnesium ribbon will displace copper and displacement reaction will occur. The reaction occurs through this, instead of producing electricity, as the displacement reaction is more direct then losing electron from magnesium and then passing through the wire and deposit on the copper wire."
83,C.T.,"My Theory 1. The longer the strip, the larger the current. because a larger strip contains more particles(atoms?ions?) so more e- can be donated into the flow. 2. The higher(nearer to the end of the strip) the larger the current? because more of the strip can be in contact with the electrolyte and ions can exchange faster? 3. Not too large not too small separation (i.e. optimum separation) is the best? New information from: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TWG-3YF49J9-35&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=6e2e59ce46c1dce3ec40fefb93627d32 ... the current increase with increasing cathode/anode area ratio but the rate of increase decreased with increasing cathode/anode ratio. The current decreased with increasing separation between the anode and cathode although the cathode elements most distant from the anode contributed a significant current."

89,A.L.,"-The higher the temperature, the higher the KE?therefore the electron move faster ? i am not so sure could this be linked actually. -i was thinking if i treat electron like water in a tube. If the atmospheric pressure is high,the water will move faster. So maybe electron do the same ?"
90,A.L.,1.i think the length of the metal electrode doesn't affect the voltage. Voltage depends on tendency of free electron. While the length of the electrode affect the life time of the cell instead of voltage. 2.I guess it doesn't matter where the connecting wires are placed. again because voltage is mainly affected by the tendency of electron. (not so sure) 3. maybe something to do with resistance? Or maybe a distance that the +ve amd -ve electrode can get the atoms needed easily ? Somehow related to the size of the metal strips?

97,E.M.,"I think it is because when magnesium strips are dipped into the acid, hydrogen gas will be produced and escape from the solution. As magnesium has a high order in the reactivity series, it has relatively faster reaction and hydrogen gas are produced quickly and escaped quickly, which produced the fume. i.l Chemical equation Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) ---> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)"

197,C.T.,"New information When metals change their appearance from a shiny to a dull colour, they are tarnished. Tarnish is a discolouration (usually dull, grey or black film or coat over metal) caused by the reaction between the metal and oxygen. It is a layer of corrosion that forms over copper, brass, silver, aluminium and other semi-reactive metals. Tarnish is similar to rust but has a slower rate of occurrence. It can be removed by washing and polishing. However, if you leave any detergent or polish on the surface of the metal, it attracts moisture, leading to a far worse problem- corrosion. Also, tarnish is not damaging- it is not dirt, and it does not penetrate the surface of metal."

Sulfur containing materials generally cause silver to tarnish and Hydrogen Sulfide is just one of these. Materials like wool, rubber bands, fuels derived from fossils, a few types of paints and rubber (latex) gloves are some of the common materials that cause tarnishing of silver. Certain foods like eggs and onions also hasten the silver tarnish process. You can therefore realize that, touching silver jewelry with oily hands or after a meal could also stain your silver jewelry with tarnish. The extent and speed with which your silver jewelry tarnishes is also related to the climate and in general, high humidity would result in silver tarnishing much faster.

This is a redox reaction. The ore is sodium chloride. Solid sodium chloride melts at 800oC. Sodium metal will be formed at the cathode, and chlorine gas will be formed at the anode. From the above example, it is obversved that: Oxidation takes place at the anode and reduction takes place at the cathode. The cations attach to the cathode and the anions attach to the anode. Actually, it is possible to obtain sodium by heating it with a reducing agent. However, as sodium is a very reactive metal, a lot of heat evergy is required. A lot of money is needed.

298,B.C.,"I need to understand The osmotic reaction you meant, is it like, the water in the apple is driven into the solution to lower its concentration, and by this, the water in the apple is reduced, so the chance of browning decreased? If this is the way, will the browning of apple/oxidation process still occur under the concentrated solution? Or is it the concentrated solution completely blocks the way of oxidation to occur? If we don't eat the apple after placing it under the concentrated solution for a long time, will it become smaller and smaller due to the continuous loss of water content in the apple (provided that the concentrated solution is very concnetrated)?

You see the browning when the fruit is cut or bruised because these actions damage the cell in the fruit, allowing oxygen in the air to react with the enzyme and other chemicals. How to prevent ??? The reaction can be slowed or prevented by inactivating the enzyme with heat (cooking), reducing the pH on the surface of the fruit (by adding lemon juice or another acid), reducing the amount of available oxygen (by putting cut fruit under water or vacuum packing it), or by adding certain preservative chemicals (like sulfur dioxide).

340,C.T.,"New information Some of us wear eye glasses made of photochromic lenses which darken when exposed to bright light. These glasses are the substitutes of sunglasses as they can reduce up to 80% of the transmitted light. The change in colour in response to light can be explained by Redox reactions. During the manufacturing process, silver chloride (AgCl) and copper(I) chloride (CuCl) crystrals are added to the molten glass in its molten state and these crystals are evenly distributed in the glass. Chemical equation Silver chloride undergo redox reaction in the presence of light: Cl --> Cl2+ + e- Ag+ + e --> Ag The chloride ions are oxidized to chlorine atoms and electron are given out. The silver ions take up the electron to become silver atoms. These atoms aggregate and block the transmittance of light, results in darkening of the lenses. The degree of darkening is dependent on the intensity of the light On the other hand, this process is reversible. The copper(I) ions are good reducing agent, they will reduce the chlorine atoms back to chloride ions. This prevents the chlorine atoms from joining together and thus the loss of chlorine gas. Cu+ + Cl --> Cl- + Cu2+ The copper(II) ions will then be reduced back to copper(I) ions by the silver as shown.

In aqueous state, as H+ are preferentially discharged than Pb2+, hydrogen gas is produced, as OH- is at a higher position in the ECS, it is more preferentially discharged than Br-, so oxygen gas is produced."

349,J.L.,"Yes. Electrolysis is not possible with solid lead(II) bromide.

350,S.T.,"Opinion Solid lead (II) bromide does not conduct electricity because ions in solids cannot move freely, i.e. immobile. When molten, the Pb 2+ and Br- ions become mobile.

351,C.W.,"My Theory Lead (II) bromide is heated to molten state(l) to provide mobile ions for electrolysis as the bonding between ions in solid state is too strong. Ions can also become mobile in aqueous state (aq), after dissolving the substance in water. However,a substance in molten state does not contain water. Hence,there is no water to be ionized to H+ and OH-. This allows other metal or non-metal ions to discharge, thus more useful metal can be produced in the process.

373,D.L.,"New information Extraction of magnesium Magnesium metal is strong reducing agent and therefore, cannot be obtained by chemical reduction method. It is extracted by electrolysis of fused anhydrous salts. A number of methods are available for the extraction of magnesium metal from its ores. The most widely used method is based on the electrolysis of magnesium chloride obtained from the seawater. This process consists of the following steps: Magnesium ions present in the sea water are precipitated as magnesium hydroxide by the addition of slaked lime, Ca(OH)2 to the sea water. Mg2+ + Ca(OH)2 -> Mg(OH)2 (s) + Ca2+ (aq) Magnesium hydroxide is separated and converted to magnesium chloride by treatment with hydrochloric acid. Mg(OH)2 +2HCL -> MgCl2 + 2H2O The magnesium chloride is crystallized as MgCl2.6H2O Fused magnesium chloride for electrolysis is obtained as follows: Magnesium chloride hexahydrate is partially dehydrated by passing a current of dry hydrogen chloride gas. The magnesium chloride thus obtained is added to a molten mixture of sodium chloride and calcium chloride (35 : 50 : 15). Magnesium chloride melts under this condition with the loss of water at about 1000 K (700 - 725ÅãC). MgCl2.6H2O -> MgO + 2HCL + 5H2O The molten mixture of MgCl2, NaCl and CaCl2 is electrolyzed in an iron cell through which an inert gas (or coal gas) flows to avoid any reaction between the liberated metal and oxygen / nitrogen of the air. The cell wall acts as the cathode, while the carbon rod dipping into the melt acts as anode. Magnesium is obtained at the cathode and chlorine is evolved at the anode. This chlorine is used in making hydrochloric acid, which is required for obtaining magnesium chloride. At cathode: Mg2+ + 2e- -> Mg At anode: 2Cl- -> Cl2 + 2e- The liberated metal being lighter than the electrolyte floats over the surface. Chlorine evolved at anode is obtained as a by-product. Metal of 99.9 per cent purity is obtained by this method."

Construction Down's cell consists of a rectangular container of steel. Inside of the tank is lined with firebricks. Anode is a graphite rod which projects centrally up through the base of the cell. Cathode is a ring of iron, which surrounds the anode. The anode and cathode are separated from each other by a cylindrical steel gauze diaphragm so that Na and Cl2 are kept apart. A bell like hood is submerged over the anode. Process When an electric current is passed through the molten mixture of NaCl and CaCl2, NaCl decomposes in to Na+ and Cl- ion. Na+ ions migrate towards cathode while Cl- ions towards the anode. The molten sodium collects in the cathode compartment where it rises to the top and is tapped off by a pipe. Chlorine is collected at the anode. Chemistry Fused NaCl contains sodium and chloride ions. 2NaCl _ 2Na+ + 2Cl- Changes At cathode Na+-ions migrate to cathode where they are reduced to Na. 2Na+ + 2e- _ 2Na (Reduction) At anode Cl--ions migrate to anode and oxidised to form chlorine gas. 2Cl- _ Cl2 + 2e- (Oxidation) Overall Reaction 2Na+ + 2e- _ 2Na 2Cl- _ Cl2 + 2e- __________________ 2Na+ + 2Cl- _ 2Na + Cl2 Draw backs Melting point of NaCl is 801C.

379,J.L.,"Working principle Factors affecting electrolysis Concentration However, if the concentration of a particular ion is high, then this can alter the preferential discharge. For example, if dilute hydrochloric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. However, when concentrated hydrochloric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen gas is still liberated at the cathode, but chlorine gas (and NOT oxygen gas) is now produced at the anode instead. The higher concentration of the chloride ions favor their discharge over the hydroxide ions.

381,M.L.,"My Theory Although there is a higher concentration of sodium ions(in the concentrated one I mean, I am not sure with the diluted one) than H+ ions, the position of ions in the ECS should be taken into consideration first (meaning H+ > Na+ 's ease of discharge) before that of the concentration of ions since the seperation in ECS between Na+ and H+ is quite large."

392,S.T.,"Opinion As we all know, metal objects can be coated with a thin, even layer of another metal by electrolysis through a process called electroplating. The object to be electroplated is made the cathode. The anode is often made of the plating metal, and the electrolyte is an aqueous solution containing its ions. When a current passes, the plating metal is deposited on the cathode. However, careful control of conditions is necessary to obtain a smooth firm deposit. Metals used for electroplating are those low in the E.C.S. The most commonly used metals are copper, silver, gold, tin and chromium. New information It is interesting to note that objects which are not metals can also be electroplated. These are first sprayed with a layer of powdered graphite or metal. They are then electroplated in the usual way. This technique is often used in making jewellery"
393,C.W.,"New information Electroplating is a plating process that uses electrical current to reduce cations of a desired material from a solution and coat a conductive object with a thin layer of the material, such as a metal. Electroplating is primarily used for depositing a layer of material to bestow a desired property to a surface that otherwise lacks that property. Another application uses electroplating to build up thickness on undersized parts. The anode and cathode in the electroplating cell are both connected to an external supply of direct current - a battery or, more commonly, a rectifier. The anode is connected to the positive terminal of the supply, and the cathode (article to be plated) is connected to the negative terminal. When the external power supply is switched on, the metal at the anode is oxidized from the zero valence state to form cations with a positive charge. These cations associate with the anions in the solution. The cations are reduced at the cathode to deposit in the metallic, zero valence state. For example, in an acid solution, copper is oxidized at the anode to Cu2+ by losing two electron. The Cu2+ associates with the anion SO42- in the solution to form copper sulfate. At the cathode, the Cu2+ is reduced to metallic copper by gaining two electron. The result is the effective transfer of copper from the anode source to a plate covering the cathode. "

395,C.W.,"Effects- Electroplating changes the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the workpiece. An example of a chemical change is when nickel plating improves corrosion resistance. An example of a physical change is a change in the outward appearance. An example of a mechanical change is a change in tensile strength or surface hardness. Limitations- Obtaining a uniform thickness with electroplating can be difficult depending on the geometry of the object being plated. The plating metal is preferentially attracted to external corners and protrusions, but unattracted to internal corners and recesses. These difficulties can be overcome with multiple anode or a specially shaped anode that mimics the object geometry, however both of these solutions increase cost."

399,E.M.,"Graphite or copper wire could not replace the salt bridge. First, it could not complete the circut by allowing ions to move towards one half-cell from the other, as they could only conduct electron but not ions. Second, graphite and copper strips could not provide ions that can move into the half-cell to prevent the build-up of excess positively or negatively charged ions in the solution. The reaction would stop in a very short time."

This shows that a salt bridge is a suitable bridge. It can complete the circut, and balance the charge in both solutions. The cell with copper wire and graphite have a reading, but the reading frops rapidly over time. This shows that metal wires and graphites are not suitable to be the bridge. This is because they cannot provide ions to balance the charge in the solution, which will cause the build up of excess positively or negatively charged ions in the solution, and the reaction will stop eventually. In the cell with no bridge, the reading is 0. This shows that the bridge can complete the cell."

422,V.Y.,"some information i found online : The glass master is rotated in the plating tank while a pump circulates the plating solution over the surface of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is galvanically drawn out of the solution and must be replenished to maintain a constant concentration in the plating bath. This is achieved using high purity nickel pellets (99.99% pure) suspended in the solution in non-conductive polypropylene bags called anode bags. The plating solution flows through the bag and over the glass master. The anode bags stop sediment formed during the nickel decomposition from reaching the solution and perhaps being plated onto to a master's surface. The nickel is packed firmly into the bag and forms part of the electric circuit. A DC current applied to the glass master is the source of the galvanic potential which forces nickel from the anode pellets in the bags into solution as ions and ultimately onto the master's surface as an electrically neutral metallic layer. The electron flow in the opposite direction to the current, from the cathode to the anode via the solution. electron are stripped from the nickel in the anode bag, travel through the external circuit before combining with nickel ions in the solution at the cathode end thus forming metallic nickel on the surface of the glass master. The current must start off quite low and be increased slowly and evenly to prevent the metalised surface from overheating damage. As the thickness of the nickel on the glass master increases, the current can be increased. The electroplating step is finished after approximately 1 hour. "

462,p.J.,"In my own understanding,electroplating is to add an new layer of materials on an surface of an object which keep the boject away from water and oxygen and therefore corrosion can be avoided. I think the principle of electroplating is to separate the cations and anions contained in the solution through direct current,which we called this method electrolysis. The cations in the solution would be discharged when we proceed electrolysis and it will appear as solid or gas(e.g. H2 and Cu) which will stick on the surface of the elctrodes and form a layer on it if metals solid are formed, we call this method electroplating. In conclusion, the underlying principle for electroplating is to get the metal cations of solution and to dicharge the the metal cations in order to form metal covering on the elctrode. Let's take an example, we can use CuSO4(aq) as the electrolyte and we use Fe and Cu as the electrode,Fe is the object which need electroplating. By electrolysis, Cu2+ ions in solution will form Cu during the process of electrolysis because it was discharged. Cu is then stick on the surface of Fe electrode and formed a layer on it, and the Fe now has the electroplating of another metal on it which corrosion is being resisted because the layer block water and oxygen from getting contact with Fe. This method is different from displacing Cu on surface of Fe by displacement reaction because neither Fe gives up its e- nor the Cu get e- from other matal. The e- which Cu get is from the direct current that we passes electricity through the solution when proceeding electrolysis. Nitrate ions will not be discharged in the process because it was held together by covalent bond which is very hard to break it because we need a huge amount of enerygy to overcome the forces of the bond held between them. Chemical equation Cu2+ +2e- ----> Cu Observation By using CuNO3 and Fe for electrolysis in order to prevent corrosion of Fe, I think a brown solid layer will cover on the Fe surface at last when the process of electrolysis is completed."

And for Cl- and OH-, I think because there's too little OH-, maybe all of the OH- are already discharged so the Cl- started to discharged too, Cl2 is the product found because the amount of OH- is not enough for producing and obvious formation of O2. Cl- is different from NO3- and SO4 because Cl- is only held by weak Van der Waals force while NO3 and SO4 is by convalent bond. So Cl- can also be discharged easily.

494,J.L.,From the lesson we learnt that ut us only nearly all used up but there is hydrogen gas accumulated and hydrogen is a poor conductor.
495,D.L.,"I have also done some research in the internet about this topic. A battery explosion is caused by the misuse or malfunction of a battery, such as attempting to recharge a primary (non-rechargeable) battery, or short circuiting a battery. With car battery, explosions are most likely to occur when a short circuit generates very large current. In addition, car battery liberate hydrogen when they are overcharged (because of electrolysis of the water in the electrolyte). Normally the amount of overcharging is very small, as is the amount of explosive gas developed, and the gas dissipates quickly. However, when ""jumping"" a car battery, the high current can cause the rapid release of large volumes of hydrogen, which can be ignited by a nearby spark (for example, when removing the jumper cables). When a battery is recharged at an excessive rate, an explosive gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may be produced faster than it can escape from within the walls of the battery, leading to pressure build-up and the possibility of the battery case bursting. In extreme cases, the battery acid may spray violently from the casing of the battery and cause injury. Overcharging, that is attempting to charge a battery beyond its electrical capacity, can also lead to a battery explosion, leakage, or irreversible damage to the battery. It may also cause damage to the charger or device in which the overcharged battery is later used. Additionally, disposing of a battery in fire may cause an explosion as steam builds up within the sealed case of the battery. I need to understand what is the best way to prevent the explosion of the cell? "

The electrolysis of dilute sulphuric acid is therefore actually the electrolysis of water. As electrolysis goes on, water is decomposed and its volume decreases. Thus the concentration of the sulphuric acid increases."

528,J.L.,"Working principle The basic idea is simple. In most liquid-propellant rocket engines, a fuel and an oxidizer (for example, gasoline and liquid oxygen) are pumped into a combustion chamber. There they burn to create a high-pressure and high-velocity stream of hot gases. These gases flow through a nozzle that accelerates them further (5,000 to 10,000 mph exit velocities being typical), and then they leave the engine. The following highly simplified diagram shows you the basic components. †rocket4[1].gifThis diagram does not show the actual complexities of a typical engine (see some of the links at the bottom of the page for good images and descriptions of real engines). For example, it is normal for either the fuel or the oxidizer to be a cold liquefied gas like liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen. One of the big problems in a liquid-propellant rocket engine is cooling the combustion chamber and nozzle, so the cryogenic liquids are first circulated around the super-heated parts to cool them. The pumps have to generate extremely high pressures in order to overcome the pressure that the burning fuel creates in the combustion chamber. The main engines in the Space Shuttle actually use two pumping stages and burn fuel to drive the second stage pumps. All of this pumping and cooling makes a typical liquid propellant engine look more like a plumbing project gone haywire than anything else -- look at the engines on this page to see what I mean. All kinds of fuel combinations get used in liquid propellant rocket engines. For example: Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen - used in the Space Shuttle main engines Gasoline and liquid oxygen - used in Goddard's early rockets Kerosene and liquid oxygen - used on the first stage of the large Saturn V boosters in the Apollo program Alcohol and liquid oxygen - used in the German V2 rockets Nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine - used in the Cassini engines"

531,O.C.,Mercury used as an electrode. I am not sure if the following information about the dropping-mercury electrode is related to what you would like to ask. A flow of mercury passes through an insulating capillary producing a droplet which grows from the end of the capillary in reproducible way. Each droplet grows until it reaches a diameter of about a millimeter and releases. The released droplet is no longer in contact with the working electrode whose contact is above the capillary. As the electrode is used mercury collects in the bottom of the cell. In some cell designs this mercury pool is connected to a lead and used as the cell's auxiliary electrode. Each released drop is immediately followed by the formation of another drop. The drops are generally produced at a rate of about 0.2 Hz.
532,K.H.,"Why this principle cannot be used in cations? Does it means that even the kind of ion like ""lead"" has a higher concentration than hydrogen, hydrogen will still be discharged instead of lead? Then why only anions could apply this principle?"

535,S.F.,"i don't think we can obtain the similar observation when using sodium electrode. First of all, sodium will react with water to form sodium hydroxide. if we neglect this, it will not occur either. as sodium is higher in the ECS, it lose electron to form ion easily. But sodium ion is in the higher position than hydroxide ion in the ECS. therefore, hydroxide ion is preferentially discharged to form oxygen. then the mass of sodium lost at anode will not equal to mass of sodium gain at cathode"
536,R.N.,"There's a new high tech water purifying machine or something named ""ALKAL-LIFE 3000SL"". Its working principle is as follows: The two chambers are separated by a special membrane with very tiny holes, holes so small that water molecules (usually in structured clusters under an electric field) cannot go through, but large enough for the ionized inorganic minerals to go through. In other words, you turn on the water and push the switch, and instantly you get a stream of alkaline water from the top and another stream of acid water from the bottom. The ionizer does not add any chemicals or minerals to the water. It only splits the minerals already in the water to the alkaline side and the acid side. If the water has no minerals, an ionizer cannot make alkaline or acid water. Antioxidant water is produced by using electrolysis. This is the same process used for metal plating, and it always results in a film or scale forming on the electrode. The better the electrolysis performance the greater the amount of scale. Electrolysis is a process whereby an electric current is passed through water containing an electrolyte (a mineral ion, for example), causing oxidization and reduction reactions that would not otherwise have occurred. The water on the anode side is oxidized and the water on the cathode is hydronized, thus antioxidant water is produced. he followings are discovered by doctors: Alkaline Ionized Water generates from cathode (- electrode) electrolysis cell of the ionizer unit Ionization process in the cathode cell H_O _ H+ + (OH)- _ 2H+ + 2e- _ H_(evaporation) _ O_ + H_O + 4e- _ 4(OH)-, as a result there of (OH)- increased. The water ionizer has the ability to convert normal tap water to an antioxidant with a negative ORP ( Oxidation Reduction Potentiality)."
537,O.C.,Electroplating changes the chemical and mechanical properties of the workpiece. Nickel plating improves corrosion resisitance. It's an example of chemical change. An example of a mechanical change is a change in tensile strength or surface hardness.
538,R.N.,"Electroplating is a plating process that uses electrical current to reduce cations of a desired material from a solution and coat a conductive object with a thin layer of the material, such as a metal. Actually the process used in electroplating is electrodeposition, which also consist anode, cathode and electrolyte. i think sacrificial protection is also electrolysis: There are two types of cathodic protection (sacrificial protection) as follows: (1) Active, in which a low voltage (usually 40 to 50 volt) direct current is imposed between the exposed parts of a structure and the ground. (2) Passive, in which an anode (positive electrode) made of a more reactive metal (such as a magnesium alloy) is sacrificed to protect a structure acting as a cathode (negative electrode)."
539,K.K.,I do not think that sacrificial method is electrolysis. A more reactive metal is only needed to be attached to the lest reactive metal. No chemical reaction occurs. Therefore it is not an electrolysis.

553,K.C.,"My Theory Electroplating can be used to resist corrosion. We can pass electric current through an electric cell, called an electroplating bath, to deposit one metal on another. Metal is taken from the anode and deposited on iron objects that act as cathode. The electrolyte contains the metal to be deposited as ions. The object to be plated is the cathode on an electrolytic cell. A salt of the plating metal is the electrolyte, e.g. chromium salt for chromium plating."

In my opion, Br2 is possibly a bleaching agent too. Does anyone stand with me?"
567,J.K.,"I think you're right. Like chlorine, bromine is also a bleaching agent, but I think the bleaching effect is less significant. Bromine has a lower position than chlorine in the periodic table, and the reativity of the elements of group VIII decreases down the group. That's why the bleaching effect is less significant."
568,A.S.,"i agree with you. As chlorine and bromine are in the same group in the periodic table, they should have the same chemical properties"

Putting our knowledge together They both are bleaching agent. "
570,J.L.,Yes I agree with you. However bromine is a slow bleaching agent comparing to chlorine
571,C.W.,"An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the chemical bonds of a substance. This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore, a substance which absorbs visible light. A reducing bleach works by converting double bonds in the chromophore into single bonds. This eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light. Chemical equation Cl2(aq) + H2O(l) --> H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) + HClO(aq) When Cl2(g) dissolves in H2O,it ionizes to form HClO(hypochlorous acid).The H+ ion of the hypochlorous acid then dissolves into solution, and so the final result is effectively: Cl2(aq) + H2O(l)--> 2H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) + ClO-(aq) "

576,S.K.,"My Theory I think we have learnt several kinds of definition. 1. The transfer of oxygen 2. The transfer of electron 3. Oxidation numbers The first method is the simplest concept of redox reactions, but then I don't find ituseful because oxygen is not involved in every redox reactions. As the second one, it is useful in writing formulae but it is hard to use this definition to define a reaction as it is difficult to see if there is any electron transfer in the formulae. As for the last one, I think this is the best one. Because just by looking at the equations, we can define whether it is a redox reaction. But there are also limitaions as the oxidation is related to the charges of the ions, so some people may mix up these two. "

581,S.T.,"Observation Electrolysis of water may be carried out in an apparatus called Hofmann voltameter. With distilled water alone, there is no observable change.

But I want to ask, since the concentration of KCl is high, then that of K+ should be high too. But why H+ is still preferentially discharged at the cathode?"
588,G.L.,"I think that it is because of the presence of H+ and OH- in NaCl(aq) which affects the products. They are preferentially discharged at the cathode and anaode respectively. However, since there is no water in NaCl(l), only Na+ and Cl- are present. Therefore, Na+ and Cl- are discharged at the cathode and anode respectively. Na(s) and Cl2(g) are formed respectively. So I think that concentration of ions is not the factor affecting the products in this case. "
589,O.C.,Hydrogen and oxygen ions are present in NaCl(aq). The final products will be hydrogen gas and oxygen gas instead if we use (aq) as they are preferientially discharged.
590,C.M.,"-their ECS series (cations: higher the position in ECS, the lower the ion is likely to be discharged) (anions: higher the position in ECS, the higher the ion is likely to be discharged) -the electrode (mercury electrode may extracts Na, Ca... reactive metal) -the concentration (more concentrated, more likely to be discharged) I need to understand Can we have a list on how the concentration and the electrode affecting the electrolysis. Is there a series like the ECS? For NaCl, we did this in class, 0.005M is VERY dilute solution and O2 is formed in the anode; 2M is dilute solution and Cl2 is formed. Is the definition of the term ""very dilute"" and ""dilute"" varies for different compounds?"
591,V.N.,"I dont know the answer to your first question. But I guess to your second, whether a solution is ""very dilute"" or ""dilute"" should depends on its molarity. And it should be pretty much the same for different compounds. I need to understand  I would like to ask where does the lines between ""very dilute"" and ""dilute"", ""dilute"" and ""concentrated"" are drawn."
592,D.L.,"i guess that the line between ''very dilute'', ''dilute'' and ''concentrated'' are varies in different kind of solution. For example, hydrochloric acid is concentrated when it is 11M, while sulphuric acid is concentrated when it is 18M."
593,V.N.,"I think the electrolysis and the redox of rusting should be the same. I mean, they give the same result. But like u said, rusting is quite complicated. So maybe it does involve other kinds of reaction that we haven't come over in our lessons yet."

603,K.H.,I think iodine is also a bleaching agent. But the reaction is so slow compared with bromine and chlorine. I think we just do not have enough time to test for the iodine.
604,S.K.,"Actually Mr Lam has talked about it in class also that bromine and chlorine are both bleaching agent. But Chlorine is a stronger bleaching agent than Bromine, so that's why we can just observe milky in the experimental setup using bromine, when the solution in the experimental set up of chlorine has already turned colouorless."

619,p.J.,"How about using another method to obtain oxygen? Like using very dilute solution ( NaCl, KI...), we knew that oxygen will be formed because OH- discharged and O2 is formed. But then what is the reason for doing this? We can just dissolve the hydrogen chloride in water then we can have hydrochloric acid,and we proceed electrolysis in HCl, then we can get the Cl2. Things we have to remember is just not to use very dilute HCl, because the concentration of Cl- is too low, we can use like 1M HCl for electrolysis."
620,C.T.,"I have doubts about the theory that OH- is discharged FIRST but that because of its small amount, it is USED UP QUICKLY, so Cl- ions are discharged.

621,C.T.,"If my theory in 1 Which anion is discharged first?apply, then maybe I could explain why concentration don't affect cations. The difference in position of H+ ions and Na+ ions in the e.c.s. is too great, so concentration can't affect the order of discharge, but as the difference in position between OH- and Cl- is smaller, a higher concentration of Cl- could 'take over' OH- and discharge first. An imaginative guess. HAHA"

624,D.L.,"I guess that the solution became more blue is because there are some solution left in the test tube after you took it to test for hydrogen, like sticking on the inner surface of the tube, so it gave a more blue solution when you performed the experiment for the second time,...i am not sure is it right..."
625,S.L.,"Electrolysis brings out the chemical process, i.e. electroplating. By refering to book P.212, we should make the plating metal like chromium as the anode. Hence, it will be oxidized and give out electron. Secondly, we should use an aqueous solution of a salt of the plating metal as the electrolyte. And of course the cathode will be the iron. Reduction occurs there. Ions in the solution will recieve the electron, and then they will deposit as metallic chromium on the iron. Eventually the corrosion resistance of the iron will be enhanced since chromium covering on top of it."
626,T.L.,"In fact, just by looking at the book on the chapter of rusting, I think that a higher temperature is prefered for a thicker layer form as high temperature is a factor that increases the rate of rusting."

As these metals have different properties and different positions in the ECS, will the electrolyte needed to be changed in order to carry out the anodization? In my point of view, I THINK that the electrolyte does not need to be changed as it is only for providing mobile ions for the process and it is not a thing that affect the result. Is this correct?"
628,T.L.,I agree with you. I think that as long as the ions from the electrode or ions formed in the redox reaction will not react or merge with ions in the electrolyte to form a insoluble salt can be used as electrolyte. The example is potassium nitrate and some other nitrate solutions
629,S.L.,"I tried to google it, and I have found that anodised aluminium are susceptible to mortar attack (lime) and chlorides (e.g. Hydrochloric acid.

If we just take normal procedures, it may result in a coating with poor corrosion resistance. Reference:http://www.finishing.com/264/71.shtml"

Different opinion I agree that H+(aq) will be discharged to form H2(g). But I'm not totally agree that OH-(aq) will be discharged to form O2(g). If we add many water to dissolve lead(II) bromide, which becomes a very dilute one, OH-(aq) will be discharged to form O2(g). But if we just add some or little amount of water, which the compond becomes dilute lead(II) bromide, Br-(aq) will still be discharged to form Br2(g), because the amount of OH-(aq) is very very small in this case."
643,V.Y.,"yes, i agree with you. in aqeous solution, H2O is present and will therefore contains H+(aq) and OH-(aq). as for molten state, it just involve the heatingg of metal which water is not present. as a result, the content will just be Pb2+(aq) and maybe Br2+(aq) itself, it willnot contain any H+(aq) or OH-(aq)."
644,B.C.,"Opinion I agree with Jessica that the lead(II) bromind was not dissolved in water, but is melted into molten state instead. But I think no matter it is in molten state or aqueous state, electrolysis can be carried out. Reason My explanation is that, if the lead(II) bromind was dissolved in water, H+(aq) inside the water would have probably been discharged instead of Pb2+(aq), since H+ is at a lower position in the ECS than Pb2+(aq), so that it is more readily discharged. So in this case, if lead(II) bromind was dissolved in water, H+(aq) would be discharged in priority to form H2(g), no matter how little amount of water is added to dissolve the compound."
645,C.C.,I need to understand how can we test for the presence of bromide in the brown gas?
646,V.Y.,"as we can see in the video, the gas was tested by a filter paper soaked with lead(II) solution which will turn into a darker colour due to the presence of bromine gas."
647,B.C.,"Observation I observe that there is brown gas coming off during the experiment. Some silvery stuff are also formed after the experiment. Working principle electron flow from the negative pole to the cathod. The lead(II)ion gains two electron from the cathod and becomes discharged to give a Pb atom. Bromind ion loses an electron to the anode and becomes discharged to give a Br atom. Two Br atoms join up to become a Br2 molecule. *The brown gas emitted is bromide vapour, which is toxic, so the experiment should be carried out in a fume cupboard. *When molten state lead(II) bromind becomes solid, there is no mobile ions. So, no current flows through the external circuit. Therefore, the reaction will stop by that time and the ammeter reading will then be decreased. Chemical equation At cathod(reduction): Pb2+(l) + 2e- --> Pb(s) At anode(oxidation): 2Br-(l) --> Br2(l) + 2e- Overall equation: Pb2+(l) + 2Br-(l) --> Pb(s) + Br2(l)"
648,S.T.,"Observation What do you observe in the experiment ? 1. Heating of PbBr2 White PbBr2 solid melts under heating to form colourless PbBr2 liquid. 2. Electrolysis of PbBr2 Silvery lead metal forms at cathode and brown bromine vapour forms at anode. Working principle How do you explain the chemistry involved ? 1. Heating of PbBr2 By strong heating, energy is supplied to overcome the electrostatic ionic attraction between Pb2+ and Br- ions. This makes the giant ionic structure to collapse and ions become mobile in liquid state and electrical conductivity is increased to enable electrolysis. 2. Electrolysis of PbBr2 At cathode, reduction occurs. Positive Pb2+ ions are attracted to negative terminal(cathode) and reduced to Pb metal. As the temp is high, the lead metal exists as liquid state. At anode, oxidation occurs. Negative Br- ions are attracted to +ve terminal(anode) and oxidized to Br2. The temp is higher than the boiling pt of Br2, so it exists as vapour state."
649,H.N.,My Theory Yes i think that electrolysis can only be carried out in molten state or aqueous solution because of the presence of mobile ions. There is no mobile ions in solid form. 
650,C.T.,"But electrocity can also pass through solids, such as human beings, at a very large current, sucha s ligtning. I believe if a VERY LARGE current pass through, electrolysis can still occurr."
651,C.M.,electrocity can pass though metals also but electrolysis is not occuring
652,K.K.,"I think the susbstance undergoes electrolysis should be electrical conductor as a complete circuit is required. It may not be in a particular form. This is related to the structure of the substance. For example, sodium chloride can undergo electrolysis in aq form but not solid form as it is a giant ionic structure."
653,D.W.,"The electrical conductivity of a substance based on the mobile ions it has. Mobile ions is present in solid metal so they can conduct electricity. But concerning electrolysis cannot be carried out in metals, I think that electrolysis is spliting a compound into two elements. For example, NaCl(l) contains two elements, sodium and chlorine. They can be seperated by electrolysis. In metals there is only one element. It cannot be further seperated. So electrolysis do not occur."
654,M.H.,"Of course, electricity can pass through solids, like metals. But i agree with Carol that electrolysis does not occur in these solids. I think they are simply electrical conductor."
655,B.C.,"I think in order to let electrolysis occur, there should be electricity passing through an electrolyte in molten state or in aqueous solution. I think there should be a gain and a loss of electron at the two electrode. Like metal loses electron and non-metal gains electron. So I think electrolysis won't occur when there are just two metals. That is simply conducting electricity between the two metals as they both have free electron."
656,B.C.,"Opinion Yes. I think that if the chemical is not in molten/aqueous/liquid state, electroylsis will not occur even in very high voltage because it requires the flow of mobile ions. It has the similar characteristic as conducting electricity, which requires mobile ions or free electron."
657,S.L.,"anet I think maybe you have misunderstood something. We cannot use electrolysis to get electricity, we need to provide this for the process. I do agree that bromide is lost during electrolysis as it has gained electron and escaped in a gaseous form. But in my opinion, it is not always happen like that. For example, we put test tubes under the electrolyte in our previous experiments, keeping the gas inside. Then there was no loss of materials. Therefore, as a whole, there should be no loss during the process of chemical cell conduction and electrolysis unless we let it go. I think these two are just the matter of transfer of electron and ions between chemicals. Although they move around and even leve their original position, they actually stay inside the set-up throughout the process. Like when we conduct a galvanic cell, zinc metal seems to be lost. But of course we know copper(II)ions takes up the electron, so zinc is ""transformed"" into copper. As a conclusion, there is ""loss"", but then ""gain"" also comes up. So things are balance. We can say there is no actual substance which we can observe is lost."
658,B.C.,"My Theory 1. There is no mobile ions in the solid lead(II) bromide and it cannot conduct electricity to carry out the REDOX reaction. So we need to heat it so that there is mobile ions to carry out electrolysis. It has to be in molten state because if we add dissolve the compound in water, H+(aq) and OH-(aq) may be discharged to form H2(g) and O2(g). If it is in molten state, the product will be Br2(g) and Pb(s), thus useful substances are produced rather than just H2(g) and O2(g). 2. 2PbBr2(s) --> 2Pb2+(aq) + 4Br-(aq) 3. Electrolysis is brought about by the passing through of electricity for the reation to occur. But electricity is generated by the reactions of the chemicals inside the chemical cell, so we use a voltmeter to measure the voltage produced during to operation of the chemical cell. And we can see that the voltage drops through time. For chemical cell, there are usually two kinds of metals. The electron flow from the negative electrode(which is the metal that has a higher tendency to form ions) to the positive electrode to generate electricity. In electrolysis, there are no ""half cell"". The reaction starts with the closed circuit with allows current to pass through and the electron flow from the negative pole to the positive pole. By gaining electron, reduction occurs at cathod, positively charged ions will be attracted to the cathod and the cations at a lower position in the ECS will be discharged. By losing electron, oxidation occurs at anode, negatively charged ions will be attracted to the anode and the anions at a higher position in the ECS will be discharged. The electrode for electrolysis are usually carbon/graphite, copper, since they are not easily reacted with the products formed. Sometimes, there are changes of the pH value near the electrode due to the discharge of H+(aq) or OH-(aq) to form H2(g) and O2(g)."
659,B.C.,"I think the products obtained won't be the same. In aqueous lead(II) bromide, there are H+(aq), OH-(aq), Pb2+(aq), Br-(aq). If it is very dilute lead(II) bromide, H+(aq) and OH-(aq) will be discharged instead to form H2(g) and O2(g). If it is dilute lead(II) bromide, H+(aq) and Br-(aq) will be discharged instead to form H2(g) and Br2(g). Br-(aq) is discharged at anode in this case because there are trace amount of OH-(aq) in the solution, so it is very difficult to be discharged. H+(aq) is preferentially discharged at cathod since it is at a lower position than Pb2+(aq) in the ECS that it gains electron more readily and it is a stronger oxidizing agent compared to Pb2+(aq). Chemical equation Very dilute lead(II) bromide: anode: 2H2O(l) --> O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e- cathod: 2H2O(l) + 2e- --> H2(g) + 2OH-(aq) dilute lead(II) bromide: anode: 2Br-(aq) --> Br2(aq) + 2e- [Br2(aq) because bromine gas dissolves into the solution again] cathod: 2H2O(l) + 2e- --> H2(g) + 2OH-(aq)"
660,T.L.,"I agree, as we see in the video, lead metal formed can be 'poured' from the container so it would be the aqueous solution. But as its freezing point is high, it bacame solid in a short period."
661,V.C.,"i agree with jessica. Cl- and OH- are attracted to anode. As OH- has a higher position than Cl- in the ECS, OH- is preferentially discharged. oxygen is formed."
662,T.L.,"principle behind:hydrogen ions have a higher tendancy to form hydrogen gas and it have a lower position in the ECS. As mentioned in the lesson, the lower the position in the ECS of a cation is, the more it will be preferentially discharged."
663,M.H.,"I agree with you that hydrogen ions are preferentially discharged than potassium ion. However, I think your explanation for Cl- being preferentially discharged is wrong. I think it should be beacuse Cl- have a higher concentration than OH-."
664,C.C.,"My Theory As the concentration of Chloride ions is higher than that of hydroxide ions, the higher the concentration of the ion the more preferentially discharged is the ion. Thus chloride ion is more preferentially discharged than hydroxide ion."
665,D.W.,"I think when the OH- ions are used up, there are still some CI- there to be discharged. So when would the reaction stop? After all the ions are discharged?"
666,C.T.,"I agree that reaction does not stop when OH- are used up, for the ecs only determine the ORDER of discharge but not whether the ion CAN be discharged. When the concentration of Cl- is eventually much higher than that of OH-, discharge of cl- take place instead"
667,V.C.,"i agree with you that when all OH- are used up, Cl- will ve discharged. I think the reaction will stop when Cl- is in low concentration because there will not be enough ions for electrlysis. but i'm really not so sure."
668,T.L.,"I agree with Vivian. When [OH-] drop until [Cl-] would be preperentially discharged and similarly, when [Cl-] drop until [OH-] would be preperentially discharged and this will continue changing until the concentration of the 2 solutions both drop until a point when they cant be discharged. "
669,M.H.,"Cl- will be discharge at the begining as it has a higher concentration than that of OH-. But after sometime, as H+ are continuously preferentially discharge, more OH- are present in the solution. Therefore, when the concentration of OH- and Cl- are about the same, OH- will be preferentially discharged then."
670,J.K.,"What's the difference between dilute and concentrated solution? If concentrated solution is used, will the product formed at te electrode be change? For example, more than one product will be form maybe, since the concentration is higher, maybe more than one ion will discharge at the same time. "
671,C.C.,what do you mean by adding oxygen gas?
672,D.W.,"So do you mean that if two types of cations with a small position difference in the ECS, their concentration will affect the tendency of them being discharged?"
673,V.C.,"i am not sure, but i think the concentration will not affect cations, even though they have small position difference. Concentration will affect the tendecy of anions only."
674,S.L.,"I found something on the Internet (http://alexteoh.com/emap-electrochem/FactorsaffectingPreferentialDischarge.html), although concentration of the ions in the electrolyte affects the order of preferential discharge...NOTE: Ions of Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Sulfate and Nitrate ions are NOT discharged even if they are in high concentrations. To me, it is like a theorem...though I think your guess is quite possible!"
675,M.H.,"You said that Cl- ions will be discharged when there are still OH- present in the solution. But I don't really agree with you. We know that when the concentration of Cl- is higher than that of OH-, Cl- willbe discharged first. But if the concentration of OH- is higher at the beginning, why shouldn't OH- be preferentially discharged throughout the whole electrolysis?"
676,D.W.,"If the concentration of OH- ions is higher at the begining of electrolysis, it will be preferentially discharged first. As the OH- is discharged and oxygen is formed, the concentration of OH- ions will gradually decrease, the concentration of Cl- ions will gradually increase at the same time. After some time, at a certain point, the concentration of Cl- ions is higher than OH-. Then, Cl- ions will be preferentially discharged due to the higher concentration."
677,V.C.,"My Theory even though the concentration of K+ is high also, mercury cathode is needed to dicharge them. Without mercury cathode, they still cannot be perferentially discharged."
678,C.C.,"Opinion As the difference in the position of the ecs between K+ and H+ is very large, where K(s)is at a high position in the ecs and that K+ has a low tendency to react while H(g) is at a relatively low position in the ecs and that H+ has a higher tendency to react, so the high concentration of K+ only made a minimal effect. Therefore, H+ still discharge instead of K+."
679,J.L.,liquid is just the pure element (or compound) that is in liquid form. aqueous is when the compound is with a water solution. this is from yahoo answers
680,D.W.,"My Theory I think the main difference between NaCl (aq) and NaCl (l) is that water is present in NaCl (aq) but not in NaCl (l).There is water in NaCl (aq). H+ ions and Na+ ions are both present as cations. H+ ions is preferentially discharged but not Na+ ions. Na(s) cannot be obtained. But I think NaCl (l) is pure sodium chloride in its molten state. As there is no water in NaCl (l), only Na+ ions are present as cations. In this case Na+ will be discharged and Na (s) is formed."
681,V.C.,"My Theory In NaCl(aq), Na+, H+, OH- and Cl- are present. Since H+ and OH- are preferentially discharged, sodium canoot be obtained. In NaCl(l), only Na+ and Cl- are present. So sodium ions can be discharged at cathode. "
682,C.C.,"I think it is because as in aqueous state,water is present in the solution thus the concentration of Na is lower than that of NaCl in molten state accordingly."
683,G.L.,"I can't find the molarity of sea water. But from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_water, I found some information from which the concentration of sea water can be calculated out. 1. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5%. This means that every 1 kg of seawater has approximately 35 grams of dissolved salts (mostly, but not entirely, the ions of sodium chloride: Na+, Cl-). 2. The average density of seawater at the surface of the ocean is 1.025 g/ml.(ie 1.025g cm-3) Consider 1000cm3 of sea water. Mass of 1000cm3 of sea water= 1.025g cm-3 X 1000cm3 = 1025g Mass of NaCl in 1000cm3 of sea water= 1025g X 3.5% = 358.75g Molar mass of NaCl= 23.0g + 35.5g = 58.5g No of moles of NaCl in 1000cm3 of sea water= 358.75g / 58.5g = 6.13... mol Molarity of NaCl in sea water= 6.13mol / 1dm3 = 6.13M Therefore, NaCl in sea water is 6.13M, which belongs to concentrated NaCl solution(>2M). "
684,V.Y.,"i agree with dekki. the terms 'very dilute', 'dilute' and 'concentrated' depend on the concentration of the solution. for example, very dilute refers to those 0.0sth ones, dilute refers to those with 0.sth ones and concentrated refers to those 1M,2M,3M, etc."
685,S.L.,"I found the defination on bk P.193! It is said that the concentration of the very dilute solution is less than 0.1M. And theefore I think dilute one should be around 0.something. I am not sure about the concentrated one, I guess maybe of 2M...because I just saw that on P.179, the problem solving."
686,T.L.,"It is because of the formation of a sepcial compound Na/Hg. In this situation, Na+ have a higher tendancy to form the compound than that of H+ discgarging to form H2."
687,D.W.,"I'm not very sure, but when I search in the Internet, I come across something like sodium and mercury will form an alloy Na/Hg (sodium amalgam). But I think this is not something we will learn at this stage."
688,S.F.,"under what condition, mercury cannot be used as electrode?"
689,C.T.,"When graphite cathode is replaced by a mercury cathode and water is put above the Hg(l) cathode, the water turns into NaOH (aq) gradually. In addition, H2(g) evokes at the interface between the mercury electrode and the water. At the Hg(l) cathode, Na+ is discharged to form Na atoms. Na is stabilized by dissolving in the Hg(l) where as sodium amalgam (alloy of mercury) is formed. By diffusion, Na atoms reaches the water and reacts to gice NaOH(aq) and H2 (g) Chemical equation 2Na (s) + 2H2O (l) --> 2NaOH (aq) + H2 (g) H2(g) and NaOH (aq) are formed, which are the same products as the products from the reaction between Na(s) metal and H2O (l). Some Na atoms(discharged from Na+) pass through the Hg cathode and reacts with the H2O(l) directly. The difference is that both sodium and mercury are metal, so sodium is soluble in mercury with the ruleÅelike dissolves likeÅf mentioned in 1 reactivity? Chemical equation At cathode Na+ (aq) + e- --> Na Na + Hg (l) --> Na/Hg (l) (sodium amalgam)...a new symbol, I've never seen forward slashes in equations?? Does anyone know how they are used? 2Na/Hg (l) + 2H2) (l) -->2 NaOH (aq) + H2(g) + Hg(l) At anode 2Cl- (aq) --> cl2(g) + 2e- Na + and Cl- ions are removed from the conc. Nacl so it becomes more dilute. **Howeverm although Na+ ions are discharged, sodium metal is very unstable in water and so the metal sodium is not obtained ***free sodium metal can only be obtained by electrolysis of molten sodium chloride."
690,T.L.,I need to understand I would like to ask will the electrolysis of mercury help to form metal of ions of other reactive metals like K and Ca?
691,M.H.,"Take electrolysis of conc. NaCl solution using mercury cathode as an example. At meacury cathode, Na+ are prefernetially discharge. Although Na+ has a hogher position in the E.C.S. than H+, they have a much higher conc. than H+. Also, when mercury cathode is used, sodium formed will dissolves in the mercury to form an AMALGAM."
692,C.T.,I believe Mr Lam said that it is the result from experiments.I believe the key of the question is to know WHY does concentration affect the order of discharge of anions in the first place. But I have no idea on this.
693,p.J.,"This is what I don't understand too. I've thought of several ideas or reasons which cause the Na+ cannot form to its metal, like its reactivity, because as all of us know that Na is a very reactive metal that if we put it into acid, it will explode, even if we put it on cold water, it burns. I'm wondering maybe the Na is not stable enough at room temp. thus it will not form to its metal. And also, I am thinking does the boiling pt. and melting pt. of the metal related to this principle or not, but I can't think of any proof to show this prediction."
694,V.C.,"Mr lam said that this cannot be applied on cations because there are no positive results found in experiments before. i.e. No cations can be perferentially discharged affected by concentration only in experiments done before. However, I still wanted to know the reason behind..."
695,M.H.,"What I think is that only when the solution is VERY dilute NaCl, oxygen and hydrogen will be formed. But when the solution are DILUTE, CONCENTRATED, oxygen may not be formed at the anode."
696,G.L.,"I think that sacrificial protection is not electrolysis as the use of electricity is not involved. However, I do not agree wuth Katie that no chemical reaction occurs. When the two metals are attached, electron will flow from the more reactive metal to the less reactive metal(iron), and thus protecting it from rusting."
697,S.L.,I am sorry but I can't really figure out how rusting is related to electrolysis...I can only think of redox reaction. Would you explain the role of electricity for me please?
698,D.W.,"I have the same question as Scarlett. Just now you provide some chemical equations of the process of rusting. But what is the relationship between rusting and electrolysis? If it is an example of electrolysis, can someone tell me what is the cathode, anode, electrolyte and products?"
699,H.N.,"The half equation at the cathode is: Cu2+(aq)+2e- -->Cu(s) and the half equation suggested by the book is: 4OH-(aq)-->O2(g)+ 2H2O(l)+ 4e- and so the overall equation becomes: 2Cu2+(aq)+4OH-(aq)-->2Cu(s)+O2(g)+2H20(l) but i want to ask if i use the half eqation suggested by Regina: 2H2O(l)-->O2(g)+4H+(aq)+4e- the overall equation will become: 2H2O(l)+2Cu2+(aq)-->O2(g)+4H+(aq)+2Cu(s) which is not the same as the one suggested by the book, then which one is correct? Or both of them can be accepted? Which one can show the actual situation more? "
700,D.W.,I think using the half equation suggested by Regina is better and closer to the real situation as there is not many OH- ions in the solution. What's more are Water molecules.
701,J.L.,Ways to increase the rate of electrolysis: - having a low resistance (the current can be larger) - moving the electodes closer to each other - use a bigger electrode which can increase the surface area - using a more concentrated electrolyte solution
702,J.L.,I know that graphite is inactive and will not react with other substances easily. So it is commonly used as the electrode. I need to understand Can we use graphite as an electrode every time in the experiments?
703,V.C.,"as carbon can react with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, i don't think carbon electrode can be used every time. i'm not sure."
704,T.L.,I agree. I also think that graphite can't be used as the electrode sometimes as it will 'break'(I am sorry I forgot the word) as mentioned in the lesson quite a long time ago. I am not sure if it is correct.
705,J.L.,I think the word is disintegra
706,J.L.,Yes it cannot be used when reacting with substances with oxygen. Mr Lam said so today
707,T.L.,"As we have learnt in the physics lesson, the AC volt will have its direction of electron flow changed every 0.01s instead of having a fixed direction. I want to ask if AC volt is used in the electrolysis process(eg. electrolysis of water), what will the product in each side be? Will it contain both H2 and O2 or what"
708,M.L.,"I agree with you, I think that through the AC power supply, both oxygen and hydrogen will be produced, but the among of hydrogen is still the double of oxygen in each tube."
709,J.K.,"I think the reaction will be slower than using a d.c supply. Since the direction of electron flow changes rapidly, then the time for the ions to be attracted to electrode will be less and the amount of ions being discharged will be less. Then less gas will be formed, and it take longer time to finifsh reaction."
710,J.L.,"electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride solution: Cathode: 2H+(aq) + 2e- -> H2(g) Anode: 2Cl-(aq) -> Cl2(aq) + 2e- overall reaction: 2H+(aq) + 2Cl-(aq) -> H2(g) +Cl2(g) From the above equation, we found out that the ratio of hydrogen and chlorine produced is 1:1. However, the amount of chlorine gas collected may less than expected because chlorine gas is slightly soluble in water. Is it correct?"
711,C.M.,"We know this in Physic with a higher temperature, the lattice ions vibrates more rapidly. The resistance will increase. My Theory i think that with a higher resistance, the thickness of the protective layer will be less"
712,D.W.,"Actually I found the information that Rainbow provided on a website. It is said that a thicker film tends to be produced by more dilute solutions at lower temperatures with higher voltage and current. But I am not sure why it is like this.

713,C.M.,Al2O3 is easily dyed.
714,S.F.,concentrated sulphuric must not be used as electrolyte as it will act as oxidizing agent. it will be reduced to form sulphr dioxide Chemical equation 2e- + 4H+ + (SO4)2- ->SO2 +2H2O
715,M.L.,"I don't think it is a random success, it might be true, but as obtaining gold from lead required a lot of money, people might as well put the money into more useful researches. It is just the same case as turning carbon to diamond."
716,E.M.,I want to ask why chemicals are involved in this reactoin? What is at the cathode and what is at the anode? What are the products?
717,D.W.,"Direct electrical current is applied to a solution of NaC1 and H2O (saline or salt water). The current causes a breakdown of this compound into the component parts that are subsequently rearranged into new compounds around the respective poles. This process is called ionization. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) forms at the negative pole and hydrochloric acid (HC1) forms at the positive pole. Either compound will achieve permanent hair removal but traditionally, the negative is used in needle electrolysis because a reaction between the hydrochloric acid and the metal of the needle produces a tattoo from a metal deposit being left in the skin. In the case of electrolysis occurring in a hair follicle, either a strong base (NaOH) or acid (HC1) will cause the destruction of the hair follicle. Measurement of the pH of the epilated hair's bulb will validate the creation of either a base or acid due to the action of the current on the hair follicle when applied either through a needle as in traditional electrolysis or through the hair as with the GHR galvanic tweezer technique."
718,S.L.,"teresa,somehow I don't thnk that the electrolysis hair removal you mentioned is related to our topic in chemistry. It seems more likely to be an example in Physics. Because when I read the information, espectially the procedues, I found that it is mainly about using electric current which passes through the hair follicle (i.e. to use electricity to damage/kill follicle directly, but not to bring out chemical reaction). Reference: http://www.electrolysishairsremoval.com/electrolysishairemovalprocedure.htm"
719,D.W.,"I think it is related to our topic in chemistry. I have got some new information about electrolysis in permanent hair removal. The positive pole, negative pole and the product are clearly stated."
720,J.K.,"I think H2(g) is useful, since it can be use in many ways. For example, if it's mix with O2(g), this will provide a large energy. Even the rocket fuels are make like that, it can provide enough energy to launch the rocket."
721,S.F.,electrolysis of seawater can also produce these useful things as sea water mainly contain sodium chloride.
722,C.C.,how can those difficulties be overcomed with multiple anode or a specially shaped anode?
723,J.L.,Yes I think so too. Mr Lam said that iodine is also a bleaching agent but a very very slow one
724,J.L.,"From the periodic table, the position of iodone is lower than bromine, that means iodine is less reactive than bromine. therefore, the rate of bleaching effect in bromine is faster than iodine. I think it is reasonable but I am not sure whether it is right or not"
725,S.T.,"he reaction of Br2 in alkali medium here (i.e. product is bromide and bromate( I) ion) is only suitable for low temperature. at higher temperature, bromate(V) is produced instead of bromate ( I) Br2 + 6 OH- Å® Br- + BrO3- + 3H2O"
726,J.L.,"Yes I agree, Mr Lam said during the lessons that in fact bromine is quite a quick bleaching agent"
727,T.L.,"Chemical equation as said in BK 2 in the book, the chemical equation of this reaction is OCL-+dye->cl-+(O+dye) In this reaction, the oxidation no. of cl cganged from +1 to -1 and it is reduced. On the other hand, the dye gains oxygen in the reaction, thus it is oxidized. I need to understand As there are millions kinds of dye in this world, I want to ask if chlorine can be used to bleach all of them? If not, what are some examples of substances that cannot be bleached by cl?"
728,A.S.,"I don't know what dye cannot be bleached by chlorine, but i know what material can't be bleached by chlorine. It is wool. Bleach whitens clothes by releasing oxygen that combines with chemicals in dye, making them colorless. The higher the pH of bleach, the greater the amount of oxygen that's released--and the whiter your clothes become. Like bleach, cotton fiber is also on the basic side of the pH scale, and cotton usually bleaches well. But wool is acidic. When you combine acidic wool with basic household bleach, you get a chemical reaction called a neutralization reaction--and the result is that the bleach dissolves the wool fibers into a goopy mess! "
729,J.L.,"I think bleaching effect is a chemical properties. As the elements mentioned are in the same group (Group VII), they have the same number of outermost shell electron in their atoms and thus they have the similar chemical properties"
730,K.H.,i guess fluorine in toothpaste can help bleach our teeth. As it always says that it can help us to make our teeth white in those tv advertisments. 
731,T.L.,"I have once heard from a friend that activated charcol(äàê´íY)can also be used as a bleaching agent. Is this correct? If yes, what will be the chemical principle behind it?"
732,J.L.,"Actually maybe all halogens are bleaching agent. As chlorine, fluorine, bromine and iodine are bleaching agent. So is Astatine"
733,A.S.,"Opinion All halogens have bleaching effect as they are in the same group in the periodic table and should have the same chemical properties. However, they might have a difference in the effect. As reactivity of the elements of group VIII decreases down the group. The bleaching effect of bromine, Iodine, astaine might be less significant. (ref: Jessica's ""i think you're right) "
734,S.T.,"actually Cl2 and Br2 do not have the SAME chemical properties, but only SIMILAR chemical properties. it is a fact that both Cl2 and Br2 are in the same group and have the same no. of outermost shell e-. however, as Br2 has one more e- shell, it has a weaker tendency to attract an incoming e- to form anion, so it has a lower reactivity than Cl2. one example here is that the rate of bleaching of Cl2 is faster than that of Br2."
735,S.T.,"halogens have bleaching ability. as i know, there is a molecule called ""cyanogen (CN)2"" which is known as ""pseudohalogen"" since it has chemical and physical properties similar to halogen. i wonder if cyanogen can act as a bleaching agent or not. "
736,S.T.,sulphur dioxide is another type of bleaching agent. it bleaches by reduction instead of oxidation. An example of using it is to bleach newspaper.

739,M.L.,"First, let us look at the oxidation number of each of the following. 1. K2Cr2O7 - Na2SO4 Cr: +8 --> +3 S: +4 --> +6 2. KMnO4 - FeSO4 Mn: +7 --> +2 S: +4 --> +6 3. Br2 - FeSO4 Br: 0 --> -1 S: +4 --> +6 4. Fe2(SO4)3 - KI Fe: +3 --> +2 I: -1 --> 0 After analysing, I have 4 different thoughts, 1.The larger different of the oxidation number is the reducing agent, the higher the oxiding power is the oxiding agent. i.e. The difference of oxidation number of sulphur in the first three expirements is 2 and the difference of oxidation number of iodide in the last expirement is 1. So the oxidixing power of the first three experiments is higher, thus the voltage of the experiments are higher. 2.The larger different of the oxidation number is the oxidixing agent, the higher the oxiding power is the oxiding agent. i.e. The difference of oxidation number of cromium and maganese in the first two experiments is 5 and the difference of oxidation number of bromine and iron in the last two expirement is 1. So the oxidixing power of the first two experiments is higher, thus the voltage of the experiments are higher. 3. The higher the voltage the larger the oxidation power. i.e. K2Cr2O7 > KMnO4 > Br2 > Fe2(SO4)3 4. The higher the ampere the larger the oxdation power. i.e. K2Cr2O7 > KMnO4 > Br2 and the Fe2(SO4)3 is a special case. I don't know if it is true, but I really hope someone could give some opions."
