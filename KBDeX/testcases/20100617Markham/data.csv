1,M,Are you doing energy-p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,F5,"Yeah, and then figure-out energy-p and put energy-p in the-work-function equation.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,F4, I get 7.95x10^-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,M,yep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,F5,For energy-p  the-work-function would be 6.6x10^-19.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,F4,I get 6.26x10^-19. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,F5,you get 6.26x10^-19 and then did you subtract the-work-function? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,F4, Let me do my calculation again… 6.26x10^-21. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,F5,"yeah, and then you use the energy-k  to get velocity . ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,F4,what? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,F5,would you use the-work-fuction equation　as the energy-k  to get velocity?  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,F4, I would think would you use the-work-fuction equation　as the energy-k  to get velocity? . ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,M,"Yeah, I think would you use the-work-fuction equation as the energy-k  to get velocity? .   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,F5,what is the mass of an electron again? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,M,I think mass of an electron is 9.11x10^-31. 9.11x10^-31.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,F5,did you  get 7.14x10^12 for the velocity? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,F4,I get 1.32x10^6.  Did you square-root 7.14x10^12? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,F5," Oh, good point.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,F5,did you get 5.51x10-1? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,M," No, I think I get the velocity a little different then you did too, so 5.51x10-1 is probably the problem.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,F5, I get 1.32x10^6. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,M,I get 5.44x10^5 so 1.32x10^6 is different.  Alright let's see.   I didn't get the same energy-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,F5,I didn't subtract the-work-function. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,F4,Weren’t suppose to are we?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,M,"Well energy-k is energy-p minus the-work-function.  I think that energy-k  was, like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,F5,I think we only use  energy-k is energy-p minus the-work-function　to find-out whether or not electron are actually eject and once we know that they are wouldn’t ejected electron have the same energyx as the energy-p?  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,M,I don't think we only use energy-k is energy-p minus the-work-function to find-out whether or not electron are actually eject.  What did you guy use as the …,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,F4,I think you do have to subtract the-work-fuction.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,M, For energy-k  did you subtract the-work-function.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,F5,we are almost there. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,M,"Yeah, I multiply that by 10^9 in my calculator so I had 1.34.  Yes, so lambda is 1.34 nm ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,F5,I think we need to put nm in angstrom.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,M, oh yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,F5,I think angstrom looks nicer.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,M,13.4 angstrom. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
