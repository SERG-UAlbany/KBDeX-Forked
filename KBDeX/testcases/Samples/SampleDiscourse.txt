A1 So we need lambda and its give us the *** so with the wavelength we can find velocity. And with...
A3 And we don't have to works [sic] with the-work-function right away.
A1 Not right away but we do need the-work-function at the end.
A3 Ok to find the...
A1 Because the important thing that for the lambda we are find the wavelength of the electron not of light
A3 Right, exactly. So, first for the electron we use Planck/mass velocity because we know the mass of an electron
A1 We need to find the mass of an electron.
A3 No, we know the mass of an electron. It's an electron.
A1 Very true, very true
A3 But we don't know...
A1 With this wavelength we would be find velocity
A2 What did they give us. For the following wavelength. So, well lambda equal [sic] Planck/mass velocity right?
A1 Yes, its tell us to use lambda equal Planck/mass velocity.
A1 You can find energy-k.
A3 Energy-k of a photon.
A1 Use energy-k of the-work-function equal [sic] energy-k equal Planck nu minus the-work-function equal energy-k of a photon and use energy-k of a photon to find the wavelength of light.
